NAME
    Object::Signature::Portable - generate portable signatures of objects

SYNOPSIS
        use Object::Signature::Portable;

        my $sig = signature( $object ); # MD5 hex of object signature

        my $sig = signature(
          digest => 'SHA1',             # SHA-1 digest
          format => 'b64udigest',       # as URL-safe base-64
          data   => $object,
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple function for generating *portable*
    cryptographic signatures of Perl data structures.

    The object is serialized into a canonical JSON structure, and then
    hashed using the MD5 algorithm.

    Any two machines running different versions of Perl on different
    architectures should produce identical signatures.

    However, the serialization method, hash algorithm and signature format
    can be customized, as needed.

EXPORTS
  "signature"
      my $sig = signature( $data );

      my $sig = signature(
        data       => $data,
        digest     => 'MD5',         # default
        format     => 'hexdigest',   # default
        serializer => sub { ... },
      );

    Generate a cryptographic signature of the $data.

    The following options are supported:

    "digest"
        The cyptographic digest algorithm, as supported by Crypt::Digest.

    "format"
        The Crypt::Digest formatting method for the signature, which can be
        one of:

        "digest"
            The raw bytes of the digest.

        "hexdigest"
            The digest as a string of hexidecimal numbers.

        "b64digest"
            The digest as a MIME base-64 string.

        "b64udigest"
            The digest as a URL-friendly base-64 string.

    "serializer"
        The serialization method, which is a subroutine that takes the data
        as a single argument, and returns the serialized data to be hashed.

        It is recommended that you use a serializer that produces canonical
        (normalized) output, and preferably one that produces consistent
        output across all of the platforms that you are using.

        By default, it uses JSON::MaybeXS. See "LIMITATIONS" below.

LIMITATIONS
    By default, this module uses JSON::MaybeXS to serialize Perl objects.

    This requires the objects to have a "TO_JSON" method in order to be
    serialized. Unfortunately, this is not suitable for many objects
    (particularly those generated by modules that are not under your
    control, e.g. many CPAN modules).

    One solution is to write a different serializer.

    Alternatively, you can write a wrapper function that uses a module such
    as Object::Serializer to translate an object into a hash reference that
    can then be passed to the "signature" function, e.g.

        package Foo;

        use parent 'Object::Serializer';

        use Object::Signature::Portable ();

        sub signature {
            my $self = shift;
            return Object::Signature::Portable::signature(
              data => $self->serialize
            );
        }

    Note that Object::Serializer allows you to define custom serialization
    strategies for various reference types.

    Object::Signature
        This uses Storable to serialise objects and generate a MD5
        hexidecimal string as a signature.

        This has the drawback that machines with different architectures,
        different versions of Perl, or different versions Storable may not
        produce the same signature for the same data. (This does not mean
        that Storable is unable to de-serialize data produced by different
        versions; it only means that the serialized data is not identical
        across different versions.)

        Object::Signature does not allow for customizing the hash algorithm
        or signature format.

        Object::Signature::Portable module can replicate the signatures
        generated by Object::Signature, using the following:

          use Storable 2.11;

          my $sig = signature(
            data       => $data,
            serializer => sub {
              local $Storable::canonical = 1;
              return Storable::nfreeze($_[0]);
            },
          );

        As noted above, using Storable will not produce portable signatures.
